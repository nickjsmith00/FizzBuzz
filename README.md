FizzBuzz:
FizzBuzz is based on a programmers’ interview on whether the programmer can actually “code”. A basic function checking divisible values.


A Number is set to Fizz (e.g. 3) and a number for Buzz (e.g. 5). A counter starts at 1 and goes up by 1 increment every timerConstant/perSecond (e.g. 1/1). When the counter reaches a multiple of your Fizz number, you hit Fizz (e.g. counter(3) / Fizz(3) = divisible). If the counter reaches a multiple of your Buzz number instead, you hit Buzz (e.g. counter(5) / Buzz(5) = divisible).
However, if the counter reaches a multiple of both numbers, you hit FizzBuzz (e.g. counter(15) / Fizz(3) and Buzz(5) = divisible by both).
Alternatively, in our implementation of the game, if no options for the counter are divisible, you pass by pressing nothing for that segment of time.

Fail methods:
When you have a Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz divisible number of counter:
-Pressing wrong one = fail (lose life)
-Pressing nothing = fail (lose life)
When you have no Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz divisible number for counter:
-Pressing anything = fail (lose life)
